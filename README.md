# The-Drinking-Game
Fun new game to play with friends whether you drink or not

Simply enter the number of people participating, enter their names and start playing!
I have made this in an incremantal version-based format by removing bugs and adding perks as we go on
In later versions I've added an option to insert custom actions and also a feature to keep a Game log (Fancy, right?)
For devices not having python, I've included executable file of the latest version.

I'll be making a java or android application of this in near future.
